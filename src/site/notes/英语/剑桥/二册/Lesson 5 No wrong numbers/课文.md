  Mr. James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now ==he has **just** bought another garage in Pinhurst.== Pinhurst is only five miles from Silbury, but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just bought twelve pigeons. ==Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury.== The bird covered the distance in three minutes. ==Up to now, Mr. Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other. In this way, he has begun his own private 'telephone' service==.
