==I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer. In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs.== I gave him a meal. ==He ate the food and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away.== Later a neighbour told me about him. ==Everybody knows him.== His name is Percy Buttons. ==He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.==
